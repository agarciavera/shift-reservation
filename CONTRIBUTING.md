## License

This project has been created with a double license so you can create your fork using one of them or both:

See [Apache license](LICENSE.md)
See [AGPL License](LICENSE-AGPL.md)

If you create your own project from this one, we will be happy if you choose only one, and we would be happier if you use AGPL. The main reason to allow for two is that you can integrate parts of code into any MIT or Apache project without worrying about implications.
