#List of things to do:
Please look at [Issues](https://github.com/propedeutica/shift-reservation/issues) for an up to date list:
- Devise for users
- Devise for admins
- Create offspring and assign them to shifts
- Improvement in reports to show users and offspring, and assignments (i.e. showing admins all the information)
- Admins should be able to modify users
- Change to nested routes
- Translation into Spanish
- ~~Installation instructions (configuration options)~~
- Mail for Devise
- Mail for all other events
- Allow admin to see the interface as one of the users (impersonate a user)


**Thank you for taking the time to help :D**
